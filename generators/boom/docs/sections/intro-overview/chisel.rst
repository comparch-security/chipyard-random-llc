The Chisel Hardware Construction Language
=========================================

BOOM is implemented in the `Chisel hardware construction language <chisel-lang.org>`__.
Chisel is an embedded DSL within Scala that supports advanced hardware design using highly parameterized generators.
It is used within multiple projects in academia (e.g. `Rocket Chip <https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip>`__, `FireSim <https://fires.im/>`__, etc) as well as in industry (`Google Edge TPU <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x85342Cny8c>`__).
