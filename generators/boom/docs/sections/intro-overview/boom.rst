The Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) is heavily inspired by the MIPS R10000 [1]_ and the Alpha 21264 [2]_ out–of–order processors.
Like the MIPS R10000 and the Alpha 21264, BOOM is a unified physical register file design (also known as “explicit register renaming").

BOOM implements the open-source `RISC-V ISA <riscv.org>`__ and utilizes the `Chisel <chisel-lang>`__ hardware construction language to construct generator for the core.
A generator can be thought of a generialized RTL design.
A standard RTL design can be viewed as a single instance of a generator design.
Thus, BOOM is a family of out-of-order designs rather than a single instance of a core.
Additionally, to build an SoC with a BOOM core, BOOM utilizes the `Rocket Chip <https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip>`__ SoC generator as a library to reuse different micro-architecture structures (TLBs, PTWs, etc).
