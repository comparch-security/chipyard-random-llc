# This is documentation for the PLSI macro description format (MDF).
# Version 0.1
# Subject to change.
# TODO: write this as a JSON schema?
# Documented by Edward Wang <edward.c.wang@compdigitec.com>

# The file in the macro interchange format is an array consisting of one or more
# of the following dictionaries, each of which defines a macro

-
    # All macros must have the following two fields to be considered a valid
    # macro.

    # The type of macro.
    # Currently valid types of macros are:
    # - sram
    # - metal filler cell
    # - filler cell
    # Each of the three types will be documented below.
    # Any other types are reserved for future use and should be ignored in
    # parsers.
    type: "invalid_demo_only"

    # Name of the macro. Must be unique among all macros in the list (and
    # hopefully in the project).
    name: "TECH_MACRO_DEMO"

# Filler and metal filler cell description.
-
    type: "filler cell" # This can be "filler cell" (no metal) or "metal filler cell" (has metal, probably a decap cell)
    name: "TECH_FILLER64" # example name

    # Vt (voltage threshold of the cell).
    # Examples of valid options include "lvt" for low Vt, "rvt" for regular Vt,
    # and "hvt" for high Vt.
    # Note: this option is not strictly validated yet
    vt: hvt

# Memory/SRAM cell description.
-
    type: sram
    name: "TECH_DEMO_SRAM"

    # Width of the memory, in bits.
    # Should be greater than 0.
    width: 64

    # Depth of the memory (number of entries).
    # Should be greater than 0.
    depth: 1024

    # Type of memory (number of ports and read/write).
    # Currently supports read-write ports only.
    # Note: this is currently de facto optional.
    # TODO: define how to handle read-only and write-only ports.
    # TODO: decide if this is redundant relative to the ports array below.
    # For read-write ports:
    # - "<n>rw" specifies a memory with <n> read-write ports.
    family: "1rw"

    # An array of port specifications.
    # There must be at least one port in an SRAM (doesn't make sense to have
    # port-less memories).
    # Note: at the moment, "port polarity" is de facto optional (inferred as
    # "active high" / "positive edge"). This should probably change.
    # TODO: fix this in PLSI
